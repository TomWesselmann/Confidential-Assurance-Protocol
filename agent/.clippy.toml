# Clippy Configuration for CAP Agent
#
# This file documents intentional lint suppressions and project-specific
# lint configurations.

# Allow zombie processes in integration tests (intentional pattern)
# Integration tests spawn subprocesses that are managed by the test framework
# or OS cleanup, not by explicit wait() calls.
#
# Note: Individual tests should still use #[allow(clippy::zombie_processes)]
# to document the intentional pattern.

# Performance-oriented borrows in hot paths
# Some borrows that clippy flags as "needless" are kept for:
# - Explicit lifetime documentation
# - Performance in hot paths
# - API consistency
